## Values / Principles / Beliefs

- **Creativity + Getting Things Done**  
  Creativity and productivity should go hand in hand, not be treated as separate goals.

- **Embrace Failure as a Step Toward Success**  
  Take risks, encourage risk-taking, and learn from failures.

- **Decision Speed is Key**  
  Effective leadership is measured by how quickly and confidently decisions are made.

- **Leadership = Moral Courage + Resource Management**  
  True leadership combines moral integrity with the ability to manage people and resources effectively.

- **There Are No Perfect Solutions**  
  Everything is a tradeoff—acknowledge it and make informed decisions.

- **Impact > Money > Freedom**  
  Prioritize making a meaningful impact over financial gain, which in turn leads to greater freedom.

- **Commit Only When You Can Fully Commit**  
  Be mindful of your capacity before taking on responsibilities.

- **Understand Your 'Why'**  
  Always know the purpose behind your actions and decisions.

- **Timelines Are Immutable**  
  Plan wisely or adjust the scope to ensure timely delivery.

- **Under-Promise, Over-Deliver**  
  Always exceed expectations by setting realistic goals and surpassing them.

- **I Love Lists!**  
  Organization and clarity are key to getting things done.

## Engineering Style

- **Software Design**

  - Design docs
  - Mini design docs
  - Architecture Decision Records

- **Software Development**
  - A good codebase is both DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and WET (Write Every Time). A good developer knows when to apply each.
  - Build single responsibility components. Each component should focus on doing one thing only.
  - Simplicity > Repeatability > Complexity.
  - UX (User Experience) > DX (Developer Experience) > Our difficulty of implementation.
  - Polish is part of the MVP (Minimum Valuable Product).
  - Iteration velocity solves all known problems in computer science.
  - I care deeply about products and value the partnership with Product Management (PM).

## General Style

- I’m really good at remembering names.

- **Nobody should ever be blocked on me.**

  - I respond to pings with priority.
  - I do not expect reciprocity.
  - I protect my flow—DND (Do Not Disturb) is DND.

- **Decision-Making**  
  If you need a decision, I will make one.

- **Adaptive Work Style**

  - I observe how organizations behave and adapt accordingly, rather than impose my own work style.
  - Expect me to be quiet at first, and then to become more vocal once I understand the environment.

- **Soft but Assertive**  
  I strive to be kind and clear while remaining assertive.

- **Late-Night Work Preference**  
  I tend to be more productive during late-night hours.
