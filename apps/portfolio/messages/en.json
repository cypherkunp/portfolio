        {
          "question": "How do you balance hands-on coding with team management responsibilities?",
          "answer": "I maintain a hybrid approach, allocating about 60% of my time to hands-on coding and 40% to management tasks. I stay involved in critical technical decisions and complex problem-solving while empowering team leads to handle day-to-day coding supervision. I use tools like Jira and Slack to efficiently manage tasks and communication, allowing me to context-switch effectively between coding and leadership roles."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you foster collaboration between engineering, product, and design teams?",
          "answer": "I prioritize open communication channels and regular cross-functional meetings. We hold weekly sync-ups where product managers present roadmaps, designers showcase prototypes, and engineers discuss technical feasibility. I encourage pair programming sessions between designers and developers for UI/UX work. We also use collaborative tools like Figma and Confluence to ensure all teams have visibility into ongoing projects and can provide timely feedback."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do you prioritize technical debt versus new feature development in your projects?",
          "answer": "I advocate for a balanced approach. We dedicate about 20-30% of each sprint to addressing technical debt, focusing on issues that directly impact performance, security, or scalability. For larger refactoring efforts, I work with product managers to allocate dedicated sprints or incorporate them into relevant feature work. We maintain a technical debt backlog, regularly reassessing priorities based on their impact on current and future development."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can you describe your process for mentoring junior developers while maintaining project timelines?",
          "answer": "Mentoring is integrated into our development process. I pair junior developers with more experienced team members on projects, encouraging knowledge sharing. We have a structured code review process that serves as a learning opportunity. I also set aside time for weekly one-on-one sessions to discuss career growth and address any challenges. To maintain timelines, I factor in mentoring time when estimating project durations and adjust team assignments to balance skill development with delivery deadlines."
